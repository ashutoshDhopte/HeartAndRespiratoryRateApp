# Context Monitoring Application

**Q1)** Imagine you are new to the programming world and not proficient enough in coding. But, you have a brilliant idea where you want to develop a context-sensing application like Project 1.  You come across the Heath-Dev paper and want it to build your application. Specify what Specifications you should provide to the Health-Dev framework to develop the code ideally.

**Ans.** 

**Q2)** In Project 1 you have stored the userâ€™s symptoms data in the local server. Using the bHealthy application suite how can you provide feedback to the user and develop a novel application to improve context sensing and use that to generate the model of the user?

**Ans.** 

**Q3)** A common assumption is mobile computing is mostly about app development. After completing Project 1 and reading both papers, have your views changed? If yes, what do you think mobile computing is about and why? If no, please explain why you still think mobile computing is mostly about app development, providing examples to support your viewpoint.

**Ans.**
