# Context Monitoring Application

**Q1)** Imagine you are new to the programming world and not proficient enough in coding. But, you have a brilliant idea where you want to develop a context-sensing application like Project 1.  You come across the Heath-Dev paper and want it to build your application. Specify what Specifications you should provide to the Health-Dev framework to develop the code ideally.

**Ans.** 

**Q2)** In Project 1 you have stored the userâ€™s symptoms data in the local server. Using the bHealthy application suite how can you provide feedback to the user and develop a novel application to improve context sensing and use that to generate the model of the user?

**Ans.**  a. Using bHealthy I can collect additional user data such as ECG, EEG, distance traveled, heart rate, etc.
          b. These data can be summarized daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. 
          c. We can calculate the trend of the user's frequency of working out and other activities. This trend can be shown in a graph to make users understand easily.
          d. For each activity and spike in the heart rate and distance traveled users will be awarded certain points. So they can set goals for each day.
          e. We can indicate the number of calories burnt daily on the calendar by drawing a circle over the numbers, with the area of the circle corresponding to the calories.
          f. Internally we can set some values as the threshold for the heart rate, ECG, EEG, etc. So while collecting the data, we can inform them whether they have some medical condition or suggest visiting a doctor. These values have to be reviewed by a doctor.
          g. We should upload the data to the cloud to support viewing it on multiple devices.
          h. After collecting the user's symptoms for a week or a month, we can show a trend for each symptom and highlight any abnormalities.

**Q3)** A common assumption is mobile computing is mostly about app development. After completing Project 1 and reading both papers, have your views changed? If yes, what do you think mobile computing is about and why? If no, please explain why you still think mobile computing is mostly about app development, providing examples to support your viewpoint.

**Ans.**
